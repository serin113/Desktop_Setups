--[[

Documentation is still sloppy, bear with me.
If you want to really understand the behavior of 
certain variables, go and check out the main Lua file.

My main goal is to make a unified config for most
stuff that's added to Conky Lua setups: rings, text, lines, etc.

I take some examples, some code from others who have also done parts of
these before, and then insert it (sloppily) into the main Lua file, and
then modify it to add more options, so almost everything can be configured
here (ideally, but, not yet).

You can also separate the tables into different files, in case you have
some sort of "maximal" (contrast "minimal") setup with LOTS of stuff being
drawn all at once. You'll have to modify the main Lua file a wee bit, of course.

Anyways, have fun playing with this. :P
